# Whiteboard integration in Nextcloud

üñµ Nextcloud Whiteboard, powered by [Spacedeck](https://github.com/spacedeck/spacedeck-open).

This app integrates Spacedeck whiteboard server. It lets Nextcloud users create `.whiteboard` files
which can then be opened in the Files app and in Talk. Those files can be shared to other users
or via public links. Everyone having access with write permissions to such a file can edit it collaboratively.

‚ö† This app is still experimental and can fail in some custom Nextcloud setups.

# üõ† Install

This app works on 64 bits GNU/Linux servers.

Spacedeck has a few **optional** requirements to be able to convert media files:
* `graphicsmagick` to convert images
* `ffmpeg` to convert audio and video files
* `ghostscript` for pdf import

As the app includes a bundled Spacedeck server, just install this app in Nextcloud app settings.
